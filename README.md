# MinistryOfCoolWalks.jl

this is the heart of the whole operation. Here I will put all the code which deals with networks and buildings (and later trees as well.). Currently we have a few functions related to calculating the suns position at different times and a (rudimentary) function to calculate the shadows of buildings passed in as a dataframe from `CompositeBuildings.jl`.

In the next days I will probably add plotting support for networks, buildings, shadows and so on.


# alternative project title
Since we are probably not going to use temperature data to inform our decisions, we might need to change the name of this project to something more ... appropriate... below I compile a list of alternative titles.

- ShadedWalks
- VampireSightSeeing
- 50 shades of walk
- shade happens.
- routing in the shade (Adele)
