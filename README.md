# MinistryOfCoolWalks.jl

this is the heart of the whole operation. Here I will put all the code which deals with networks and buildings (and later trees as well.). Currently we have a few functions related to calculating the suns position at different times and a (rudimentary) function to calculate the shadows of buildings passed in as a dataframe from `CompositeBuildings.jl`.

In the next days I will probably add plotting support for networks, buildings, shadows and so on.
