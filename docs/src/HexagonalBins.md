# Hexagonal Bins
## Introduction
I guess this is the best way to aggregate some properties over a geographic area. Since I need a very specific set of aggregations and want to plot them in `Folium.jl` (or `Leaflet.jl`, if I could get that thing to a stable state...)

## Remarks
The binning function works, but is not really flexible enough for being this complicated...
